    <p>One day 5 years ago I decided to start coding to make a mod so I learned javascript I soon realized I needed to learn java and was like whatever then I forgot about minecraft and then one day I was bored in math class and I thought what if I made somthing that calculates cubed roots since I saw a question for a rectange with a volume of 200ml so I was like but why not cube? so I made it and It worked I also made it so you could use multiple roots so I just started coding alot then I thought why don't I put it on the internet so here you go!</p>
